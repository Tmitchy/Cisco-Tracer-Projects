# Network Infrastructure-Projects
Practical exploration of essential networking concepts and skills, to maintain network connectivity, understand documentation and network services, and effectively troubleshoot and secure network infrastructures.

Tool: Cisco Packet Tracer

How to Use It: <br>
By understanding network concepts and having knowledge of networking infrastructures, Network protocols, Network Operations, Network Security, Network Implementation, Network Troubleshooting, and by assigning an IP address for swift communication with other devices, the Network Infrastructure can be utilized effectively. However, there are configurations to be made on each network device. 

What I have learned and am still practicing:<br>
It is a fundamental set of networking skills that doesn't require real hardware. Allowing me to visualize how a network works, how to practice my network knowledge, build and design networks, and experiment with various networking technologies and protocols.

Security Concepts Involved: Setting Passwords, firewalls, WPA3, and ACLs for switches and routers.
