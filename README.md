# Strategic Network Infrastructure Initiatives
In-depth exploration of key networking concepts and skills to ensure network connectivity, understand documentation and network services, and effectively troubleshoot and secure network infrastructures.

Tool: Cisco Packet Tracer. Open the file with Cisco Packet Tracer (pkt).

How to Use It: <br>
Understanding network concepts and having knowledge of networking infrastructures, Network protocols, Network Operations, Network Security, Network Implementation, Network Troubleshooting, and assigning an IP address for swift communication with other devices gives you an understanding of how Network Infrastructures can be utilized effectively. 

What I am learning:<br>
I am learning essential networking skills using this tool, which does not require real hardware. It allows me to visualize how networks operate, practice my knowledge, design and build networks, and experiment with various networking technologies and protocols. Additionally, I can apply security features within a network.

Security Concepts Involved: Setting Passwords, firewalls, WPA3, and ACLs for switches and routers.
